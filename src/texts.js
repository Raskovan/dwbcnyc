Non-dogmatic and without any gods or commandments, it has enabled people to benefit both others and themselves. Especially today, with the many independent thinkers and new communication techniques, it has become possible to collect, organize and distribute Buddhist teachings, old as new, in attractive and fresh ways.  \n\n“Diamond Way Buddhism” offers a rich access to all levels of these resources. Selected from the most essential instructions by qualified teachers to be useful to modern people, this website focuses on the Diamond Way teachings of the Karma Kagyu school headed by H.H. Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje.'

// 	'Diamond Way Buddhist Center New York is part of an international network of over 600 meditation centers in the Karma Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. The centers were started due to the unique inspiration of Lama Ole Nydahl according to the wishes of H.H. 16th Karmapa. They are now under the spiritual guidance of H.H. 17th Gyalwa Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje.\n\nOur centers consist of people and families working full-time jobs, and incorporating Diamond Way teachings and meditations into their daily lives. Members share responsibility for guiding meditations, answering questions, and giving explanations about Buddhism; their work is unpaid, and based on idealism and friendship.'

The lecture is followed by a guided meditation. All are welcome to join.'

// 	'In Buddhism, meditation means “effortlessly remaining in what is.” This state may be brought about by calming and holding the mind, by realizing compassion and wisdom, or by working with the body’s energy channels and meditating on Buddha forms of light and energy. The most effective method is the constant identification with one’s own Buddha nature which is taught in the Diamond Way. When the oneness of the seer, what is seen, and the act of seeing is unbroken – during and between the times of meditation – the goal of the Great Seal (skt. Mahamudra) is reached.\n\nThe main practice in all our centers is the Guru Yoga meditation on the 16th Karmapa. This meditation is guided in English and involves visualization and mantra recitation, allowing space, clarity and joy to naturally arise.'
